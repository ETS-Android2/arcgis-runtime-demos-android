# android-geotrigger-monitoring-demo

This code sample demonstrates monitoring Geotriggers in a Foreground Service on Android. Learn more in the associated [blog post]().

The directory `GeotriggerMonitoringDemo-WithoutGeotriggers` demonstrates the app before adding Geotrigger monitoring, whereas the directory `GeotriggerMonitoringDemo-WithGeotriggers` demonstrates the app after adding Geotrigger monitoring.

## Features
* Geotriggers - Monitor device location as it enters and exits areas of interest
* Android best practices - Uses a clean architecture approach to using the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Android

## Instructions

1. Fork and then clone the repo.
2. Set your API key in the `app/res/values/strings.xml` file. *
3. Run the app and accept permission requests.
4. Long-press the map to create a point of interest.
5. Tap "Start Monitoring" to create a geotrigger with fences at the points of interest, buffered by 50.0 meters.
6. Tap your device's home button to move the app to the background. Observe toast messages as your device enters and exits fences.
7. Pull down the notification bar to view the foreground notification and tap "Stop" to stop monitoring.
8. Tap "Clear points" to remove all points of interest.

* API key: A permanent key that gives your application access to Esri location services. Visit your ArcGIS Developers Dashboard to create a new API key or access an existing API key.

## Requirements

* Android device at API 23 or above
* Network access
